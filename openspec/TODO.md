# OpenSpec TODO

## Deferred follow-up

- (none open)

## Resolved

- OmniRoute API bridge combo routes — DONE and deployed (2026-06-22). The fork
  exposes `GET /api/combos` and `GET|PUT /api/combos/fmo-*` on the bridge
  (OmniRoute commit `886ceb750`); `POST /api/combos/test` stays bridge `404` by
  design. Production `/opt/apps/omniroute` is pinned to `origin/main`
  (`a5a77e484`, image `omniroute:a5a77e484`) and verified live on
  `127.0.0.1:20129`: `GET /api/combos` → `401` (reaches OmniRoute auth, not a
  bridge `404`), `POST /api/combos/test` → `404`. Prod `apply`/`diff`/`full` can
  now reach combo management.

## Dropped (not needed for project essence)

- AA provider/detail/performance endpoints — the single free-tier endpoint
  (`GET /api/v2/language/models/free`) already provides every scoring input
  (`intelligence_index`, `coding_index`, `agentic_index`,
  `median_output_tokens_per_second`, `median_end_to_end_seconds`). YAGNI.
- models.dev cache/ETag hardening — the orchestrator runs once per day, so
  ETag/conditional caching is pointless (nothing to reuse between days).
  Schema-drift reporting is already covered by `add-real-source-ingestion-tests`.
