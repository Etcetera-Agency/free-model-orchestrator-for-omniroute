## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Live quota source fetch

The system SHALL fetch live quota (limit, remaining, reset) during quota reset
and reclassification from OmniRoute `GET /api/usage/quota` (or the configured
provider's own quota surface), unless quota values are explicitly injected. The fetch SHALL use configured
credentials with bounded retries and structured errors. When the quota source is
unavailable or returns stale data (beyond the configured freshness window), the
system SHALL fail closed — it SHALL NOT infer usable capacity from missing or
stale quota.

#### Scenario: Quota fetched at reset
- GIVEN a quota reset window is reached and no quota values are injected
- WHEN reclassification runs
- THEN current quota is fetched from the configured source
- AND effective-remaining is recomputed from the fetched values

#### Scenario: Quota source unavailable
- GIVEN the quota source is unavailable or returns stale data
- WHEN reclassification runs
- THEN no usable capacity is inferred
- AND the endpoint is excluded or degraded rather than treated as free
