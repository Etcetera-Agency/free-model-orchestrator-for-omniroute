# quota-manager Specification

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Effective remaining counter

The system SHALL compute effective remaining quota from live counters, recent
attribution and reservations. If every counter source is unknown, effective
remaining SHALL be unknown. Pending reservations and safety buffer MAY make
effective remaining negative; that result SHALL be preserved.

#### Scenario: No reliable counter
- GIVEN no reliable live, attributed or reserved counter exists
- WHEN effective remaining is computed
- THEN the result is unknown

#### Scenario: Negative effective remaining
- GIVEN pending reservations plus safety buffer exceed remaining quota
- WHEN effective remaining is computed
- THEN the negative value is returned

### Requirement: Hard-stop gating

The system SHALL require provider hard-stop semantics before treating free quota
as usable.

#### Scenario: No hard stop
- GIVEN a provider has free quota but no confirmed hard stop
- WHEN quota is evaluated for allocation
- THEN the endpoint is rejected

#### Scenario: Hard stop false
- GIVEN `require_hard_stop(False)` is called
- WHEN validation runs
- THEN it raises `ValueError`
